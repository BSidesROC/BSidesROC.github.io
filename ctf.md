## About this Event
Quest CTF is an online and in person capture the flag competition
consisting of two stages. The idea of this competition is to mix a
traditional red team/classic CTF with scavenger hunt like tasks. This
competition has been crafted to challenge players in various aspects
of hacker culture, including but not limited to, simple enumeration
and problem solving, crypto-challenges, advanced computer hacking
techniques, knowledge of blue team defensive techniques, knowledge of
pop culture references, hardware hacking, and lockpicking to name a
few. This CTF will require teamwork and it is recommended to play with
a group of players.

## How does this CTF work?
The first stage of this CTF will be conducted online with the initial
kickoff beginning two weeks before BsidesRoc on March 10th, 2020 and
will continue up through the beginning of the conference.
The first stage will consist of online challenges where players must
complete a challenge on a given server or site and the flag collected
will lead them to the next challenge.
The last flag collected in the online portion of the CTF will give the
player(s) a clue on where to start the next part of the competition.


The second phase of the CTF will officially begin during the first day
of workshops at the BsidesRoc conference, Friday March 20th.
During the conference, the players will have to solve challenges
located either online, or physically at the conference to move forward
to the next challenge. Many of these tasks will be physical challenges
and may include various amounts of activities including finding a
person, talking to people, looking for specific items, breaking into a
thing, or solving a puzzle. All physical tasks will be isolated to the
conference center or the immediate surrounding area.
Points/progress will be tracked through an online scoreboard system,
and prizes will be awarded for 1st – 3rd place. Consolation prizes
will be handed out in the event there is no winner based off the
furthest completed challenge.
Players will be required to register prior to the start of the event
and make a team name. Again, teams are welcome and encouraged.
