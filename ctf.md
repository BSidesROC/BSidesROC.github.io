# Hard Place CTF

We are pleased to announce the B-Sides ROC capture the flag cyber security event on Saturday March 19, 2022.

{:.text-white}
#### About this Event 
This capture the flag is a jeopardy style game with some practical exercises mixed in. Points will be awarded through a 
CTFd-style dashboard that must be registered for when it becomes available. We anticipate it will be a day or two before
the B-Side ROC event, at which time you'll need to sign-up using a valid email address.

You will need to be armed with at least some core level Information Technology, Cyber Security, and Pop Culture
knowledge that you'll use to answer questions, riddles and to capture flags hidden around the Internet. Yes, you can use
the Google's if needed.

#### How does this CTF Work?
This CTF is designed for beginners and experts alike and participants can play as alone or as a team. Yes, there are a 
TON of simple low-hanging fruit questions, but there are also some rather challenging technical problems as well as one 
or two brain breakers.

Why Jeopardy-style? There are a few answers to that question, but the simple ones are the best. The last couple of years
have been hard on everyone and we the developers thought it would be more fun to allow people to work collectively and 
interact with one another rather than play a role in the traditional hunger games style CTF.

We sincerely hope you find a way to use this event as a means to hangout, even if it's just online. We suggest you get 
on the B-Side ROC Discord, discuss the questions, brainstorm the answers, interact with other humans, and enjoy life for
a minute. Make a drinking game out of it, make some new friends, or just create yet another reason to razz your friend 
Pat.

I really hope you enjoy the event -
