      <description>Besides our crew of volunteers and operators, the organization stays above board thanks to a small group of directors. This a small elite group that takes responsibility for the less funn stuff like finances, insurance, and legal issues.
Bill &amp;ldquo;JustBill&amp;rdquo; Bukowski (Director)
JustBill brings expert level knowledge in the latest enterprise technology to the group. He is a “Manager” of IT for the largest market research company in the world. He no longer needs to actually know things but make sure you have your management slide ready for him just in case he cares.</description>

      <description>One of the goals we have with BSidesROC is to foster open discussion between attendees, speakers, and staff. Expressing radical viewpoints is welcome, and a high degree of skepticism on all sides is expected. Regardless, we aim to make BSidesROC a safe environment for everyone. We hold to the hacker ethos that what you look like is not important, your brain is what matters. As such, insulting or harassing other participants is unacceptable.</description>
