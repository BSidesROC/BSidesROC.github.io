This year we will have a fully working electronic badge that will be reprogrammable! due to lead times being so sort, we could only get about 200 Badges put together, but everyone will get a PCB if they did not sign up for the fully assembled badge.

The badge has TWO [Shitty Add-Ons](https://hackaday.io/project/52950-shitty-add-ons) ports on each top corner of the badge, no rotation.

The badge has the two data pins connected to pin 2 and pin 0 of the ATTINY85 Microcontroller for doing any kind of control required to the Shitty Add-Ons. The programming port is a Amphenol ICC 20021321-00008C4LF - Its super tiny to prepare for that! We are using a Amphenol FCI 20021221-00008C4LF Male connector for programming the badges, its 1.27mm Pitch, this requires very small guage wire to interface with!

There will be a contest this year for best hacked badge, prizes will be awarded!
