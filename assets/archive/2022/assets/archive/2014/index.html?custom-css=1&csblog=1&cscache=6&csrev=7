BSidesROC 2014 is in the books and fun was had by all. Thanks to our sponsors, volunteers, attendees, and friends in between that made the event happen. I can't possibly summarize all the fun things that happened yesterday but let me name a few:
<ul>
	<li>David Kennedy shared his view of a world where a purple team exists</li>
	<li>During our Lightning talks a Cisco 0-day was dropped</li>
	<li>Malware infected a live point of sale system during a presentation</li>
	<li>A quad copter flew around the room and hilariously crashed</li>
	<li>Some people noticed that the balloons were transmitting a message in Morse code</li>
	<li>We launched a hamburger resource exhaustion attack on one of the food trucks</li>
	<li>People don't mind dancing awkwardly for Dogecoin</li>
</ul>
Please, if you see sponsors this year, let them know that you appreciate them sponsoring BSides this year, and go and check out their product and service offerings.
