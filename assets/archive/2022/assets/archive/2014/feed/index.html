<p>BSidesROC 2014 is in the books and fun was had by all. Thanks to our sponsors, volunteers, attendees, and friends in between that made the event happen. I can&#8217;t possibly summarize all the fun things that happened yesterday but let me name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>David Kennedy shared his view of a world where a purple team exists</li>
<li>During our Lightning talks a Cisco 0-day was dropped</li>
<li>Malware infected a live point of sale system during a presentation</li>
<li>A quad copter flew around the room and hilariously crashed</li>
<li>Some people noticed that the balloons were transmitting a message in Morse code</li>
<li>We launched a hamburger resource exhaustion attack on one of the food trucks</li>
<li>People don&#8217;t mind dancing awkwardly for Dogecoin</li>
</ul>
<p>Please, if you see sponsors this year, let them know that you appreciate them sponsoring BSides this year, and go and check out their product and service offerings.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We work hard every year to try and come up with a cool conference but the truth is we don&#8217;t know without getting feedback from you, the attendees. Please take a minute, if you haven&#8217;t already, to fill out our very short survey. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/227FJRK">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/227FJRK</a></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you aren&#8217;t already aware, one of the events we have at BSidesROC is a crypto challenge. For the past few years, we&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to have <a href="http://twitter.com/@darthnull">@darthnull</a> plan these out for us. Last year, we had a few teams of folks that spent the entire con working on just this (and the winners finished right at the end of the day!).</p>
<p>This year is no different &#8211; darthnull has got a great puzzle planned! It&#8217;s got the usual things:</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple levels, each building on the last</li>
<li>interesting ciphers</li>
<li>a fun story</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This year, it&#8217;s also got a twist that&#8217;s a little different: a &#8220;scavenger hunt&#8221; of sorts. The basics of it are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hidden throughout the venue are going to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_drop">dead drops</a></li>
<li>Each of these will contain clues for the puzzle.</li>
<li>Players will need to find the dead drops &#8211; in the correct order &#8211; to be able to obtain the clues.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to the whole thing &#8211; but we don&#8217;t want to give too much away beforehand. We&#8217;ll have details at the con, day of. However, we&#8217;re pretty excited about this &#8211; it should make the whole thing a lot more fun, and it has the added benefit of providing some amusement for the rest of the attendees, as they watch folks wander around the building trying to find the drops =)</p>
