		<div class="speaker-header">

		<p class="speaker--speaker">Justin Moore</p>

		<p>Length: 50 Minutes </p>

		 <p>Location: Track 1 at 1600</p>
		</div>

		 <p><strong>Talk Description:</strong> Burp Suite is an intercepting HTTP Proxy, and it is the defacto tool for performing web application security testing. While Burp Suite is a very useful tool, using it to perform authorization testing is often a tedious effort involving a &#34;change request and resend&#34; loop, which can miss vulnerabilities and slow down testing. AutoRepeater, an open source Burp Suite extension, was developed to alleviate this effort. AutoRepeater automates and streamlines web application authorization testing, and provides security researchers with an easy-to-use tool for automatically duplicating, modifying, and resending requests within Burp Suite while quickly evaluating the differences in responses.  </p>

		<p>Length: 20 Minutes </p>

		 <p>Location: Track 3 at 1430</p>
		</div>

		 <p><strong>Talk Description:</strong> IDA Pro -- the &#34;gold standard&#34; of binary analysis tools -- is very good at what it does, but it comes with a hefty price tag that is usually only justifiable to professional reverse engineers. Several alternatives have begun to challenge the status quo of reversing tools, including Binary Ninja: a powerful, affordable static-analysis tool. While I attempted to convert to using Binary Ninja, I often missed the fusion of static and dynamic analyses that IDA provided, and existing Binary Ninja debugger integrations were not designed with Windows users in mind. So, I wrote a plugin that syncs WinDbg to Binary Ninja to combine Binary Ninja&#39;s static analysis features (such as the disassembly graph and the IL) with the power of dynamic analysis (such as virtual function table resolution and knowing the outcome of branch instructions).</p>

		<p>Length: 50 Minutes </p>

		 <p>Location: Track 2 at 900</p>
		</div>

		 <p><strong>Talk Description:</strong> The goal of Jeremy Bentham&#39;s Panopticon was to allow a single watchman to observe everything going on in a large building. This is similar to what threat hunters and blue teamers want - a single point to observe all the potentially malicious activities happening on a network. This talk presents one toolset that can provide this visibility using a mixture of no-cost and open source tools deployed on commodity hardware.</p>

		<p>Length: 50 Minutes </p>

		 <p>Location: Track 1 at 900</p>
		</div>

		 <p><strong>Talk Description:</strong> As long as there is a &#34;Patch Tuesday&#34;, and software has bugs, there will always be an attack vector to which defensive controls are unable to defend. This is because most defensive strategies have focused on stopping attacks at their initial vector. In this talk, I will go over how I attack and bypass most deflection controls and go under the detection radar. I will then highlight the areas where defenders can begin to build a detection defense which will identify attacker behavior regardless of the initial vector. I will run through attacks I have used, which bypass several deflective controls, and show you how you can create detection controls to detect me; that is, if you can.</p>

		 <p><strong>Talk Description:</strong> Over the past year, we&#39;ve witnessed a shift in malware used by both the common criminal, and targeted actor alike. While ransomware was the bell of the ball in the past, it has been replaced with the up and coming cryptocurrency miner. This talk will explore the trends witnessed in the past year as they pertain to the rise in popularity of cryptocurrency miners being used and deployed by criminals. We&#39;ll talk about how and why this transition has occurred, as well as a number of interesting case studies about how this malware winds up on a victim&#39;s machine. Finally, we&#39;ll also discuss the most popular cryptocurrencies being mined today, and strategies you can take to mitigate this threat. </p>

		 <p><strong>Talk Description:</strong> With social media, anyone can become &#34;incidentally infamous&#34; in minutes. Your tweet could go viral, your gif could get posted by a president, or the media could single you out because they think you made Bitcoin. This happens to hackers too, @MalwareTechBlog was arrested after DEF CON 2017 and certain media started doxing him and painting him as a spendthrift criminal based on his Twitter posts. Rather than become a social media hermit to prevent this, just set up a Sentry. This talk will present Sentry, an automated cross-platform application that will silently watch your social media for trigger words and unusual behaviors before springing into action. In minutes Sentry can lock your Twitter account, delete your Reddit comments, disable your websites, and a whole host of other actions to keep attention away in high visibility, low-privacy situations. Released under the MIT license and easily extensible, virtually any site and any API can be scripted with a bit of C#.</p>

		 <p><strong>Talk Description:</strong> Developing and maintaining an effective SIEM often takes a small army, and can be quite vexatious. In this talk, the audience will be presented with a compilation of the best and most effective SIEM use cases. Gone are the days of noisy, false positive prone alerts – this talk is focused on high accuracy use cases only! We will tie these use cases back to activities performed by threat actors and red teams alike. This talk will be of interest to SOC analysts, security engineers and SIEM content developers.</p>

		 <p><strong>Talk Description:</strong> DNS is a locked system - you can’t model the domain space at scale unless you get an AXFR from every authoritative nameserver there is, but you might be able to get a good model going if you attempted to discover and resolve all FQDNs. So, we’ll do the latter! dnstrace is a volunteer-supported, free suite of software that harvests, analyzes, and visualizes the relationships between domains so we can finally turn “domain information” into “domain intelligence” for everyone. Ever wanted to generate better domain reputation so grandma doesn’t get sent to the 200th .ru domain registered today that serves Flash malware? Or wanted to evaluate patterns in cybercrime at a global scale using domain data? Through big data and careful analysis, we can push the security envelope until we’re ahead of the curve for the first time since Creeper.</p>

		<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Chris “tweedge” Partridge is a 3rd year student working on his Bachelor&#39;s in the Computing Security major at RIT, Black Hat 2017 alum, and BSidesROC regular. He’s extremely passionate about making sure he doesn’t have to take any more 11pm phone calls from his family about their computers being infected, and has been putting a disproportionate amount of time into making that happen. He believes that writing and enhancing security technologies coupled with better security education can change people from “easy targets” to “not worth it.” As the core author of dnstrace, he’s starting to bring those dreams to life, one caffeine-fueled music-blasting coding-session at a time.</p>
