While the thought of NSA hiring hackers or engaging in cyber warfare might be fairly common today, it was not always the case. Somebody had to be first, and the policies, procedures, methodologies, and rules of engagement had to be developed for not only conducting what we called Vulnerability and Threat Assessments, but for successfully navigating the politics, bureaucracy, and reticence of this often-misunderstood clandestine organization. The first NSA penetration testing team was assembled as a part of the newly formed center of excellence called the “Systems and Network Attack Center” (SNAC). To quote Charles Dickens, “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness…” Come hear some war stories from the early days and see how this industry and the practice of penetration testing has evolved in the past 25 years.</td>

      <td>The security industry is quick to point out that data breaches can negatively affect the public perception of an organization. While regulatory fines and lawsuits may impose tangible financial penalties, they often represent only a slap on the wrist compared to the possible cost of maintain an effective security program. With over two hundred breaches disclosed against public companies in the last thirteen years, we investigate if security shortfalls breached organizations can be measured via their stocks. In this talk we will examine and expand upon existing work on identifying the effects of announced breaches on publicly traded companies. Using this expanded dataset we will conjecture on possible future trends that may occur as a result of breaches and try to better quantify the question of how much a breach may costs.</td>

      <td>Today, large organizations deal with the challenge of running their infrastructure across many networks and namespaces due to the use of cloud and hosting services, legacy environments and acquisitions. This can make it difficult for an organization to maintain visibility of its Internet-facing assets and an ability to track down systems that pose a risk to its security posture. The OWASP Amass Project attempts to help organizations perform network mapping of its attack surface and better understand how its assets are distributed across the networks of trusted partners. During this talk, contributors to the project will discuss how OWASP Amass takes subdomain enumeration to the next level, providing both attackers and defenders better visibility.</td>

      <td>Kubernetes: DevOps vs “Security People”</td>
      <td>In 2019, surveys are saying that 90% of Fortune 500 plan on using containers and things like Kubernetes, yet there’s still a divide between what “security people” see that containers provide and what Devops teams see. Kubernetes has become the defacto standard for production container deployments and there are 98 different options (as of February 2019) for hosted Kubernetes clouds. In many cases a Kubernetes threat model becomes compromised either by accident or by alibi and even if you wanted to harden your environment, there’s little guidance. Is there truly such a thing as a Kubernetes best practice? How can Kubernetes handle multiple tenants in a cluster? Do hosted Kubernetes services provide enough security for your work load? This talk will explore Kubernetes’ known attack vectors, defenses, and see how we can bridge the silos between security engineers and developers to help in the future.</td>

      <td>Jackson Deserialization Vulnerabilities</td>
      <td>The Jackson JSON processor offers an alternative to Java serialization by providing data binding capabilities to serialize Java objects to JSON and deserialize JSON back to Java objects. Poorly written Java code that deserializes JSON strings from untrusted sources can be vulnerable to a range of exploits including remote command execution (RCE), denial-of-service (DoS), and other attacks. These attacks are enabled by polymorphic type handling and deserialization to overly general superclasses. This talk describes the features of Jackson serialization that makes it susceptible to exploitation, demonstrates a working exploit, and identifies effective mitigation strategies.</td>

In this work, we present Deep Fingerprinting (DF), a new website fingerprinting attack against Tor that leverages a type of deep learning called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The DF attack attains over 98% accuracy on Tor traffic and can even defeat some recently proposed defenses against website fingerprinting. The success of this attack shows the value of deep learning techniques in security applications.</td>

      <td>Data Access Rights Exploits under New Privacy Laws</td>
      <td>New privacy laws such as the GDPR and CCPA have greatly advanced individual data rights, although the ability to request access to all personal information held by a company has created new attack vectors for OSINT. These data access requests are usually managed by legal or compliance teams without security review, increasing the potential for phishing, social engineering, and “legal DDoS.” This talk covers regional personal data access options, how most companies respond to data access requests, and exploits for common privacy vulnerabilities. We’ll explore the psychology driving corporate responses to requests and ways to exploit these emotions, as well as the best targets for a weak privacy program. For the blue teamers, phishing detection and defense strategies will be presented. Rather than ignoring or fighting against the regulations, we’ll look at ways to use these laws to discourage, detect, and disrupt such attacks. We’ll consider strategies for working with legal teams, getting security review into the process, and conducting red team reviews on the data access mechanism. Best practices for identifying data subjects, minimizing the data released, and legally denying abusive requests will be covered. Key sections of the laws to know for exploits and defense will be highlighted.</td>

      <td>Threat Hunting and Other Arcane Magic</td>
      <td>Threat hunting is often misunderstood. This talk is meant to dispel some misconceptions as well as build a foundation to perform hunts in any network.
