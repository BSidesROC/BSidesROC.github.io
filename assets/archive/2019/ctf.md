This year will be a more in person CTF this year. Make sure to bring a Ethernet Cable and a well protected laptop with metasploit, you are going to want it! Make sure to Bring you SSH Keys, and the badge will have some hidden flags on it as well :)

You will be put on a private network only accessable in the CTF Room, it will require ethernet to interfaces to the switches at the table and 2.4Ghz/5Ghz Wifi!

Team sizes are 5 members, make sure to pick well!

If you're new to CTF, or just want a comprehensive refresher, some of our friends from [THE HACKERGROUND](https://www.thehackerground.com/) are offering CTF training the day before the conference.
