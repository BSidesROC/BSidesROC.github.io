<p>Security B-Sides Rochester, or BSidesROC, is an open, non-profit hacker conference in Rochester, NY. It provides a place for people to learn about hacking, infosec, and all kinds of different technology in a fun environment.</p>

<p>Our seventh year was another action packed event that included presentations from industry professionals, games and challenges that exercised your hacker skills, as well as community involvement that represents the Rochester community. We helped students and employers match up to see if we can’t turn the amateur hacker into a career plan.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick summary of our conference based on surveys from attendees:</p>

<h1 id="c-type-faqtxt">C:\&gt; TYPE FAQ.TXT</h1>

<p><strong>This is fun, can I volunteer?</strong></p>

<p>If you’re interested in this year’s volunteer opportunities, you can email volunteer at bsidesroc.com.</p>

<p><strong>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?</strong></p>

<p>There will be no ID requirements to get into the conference. This is not a child oriented event but all are welcome.</p>

<p><strong>What should I bring into the event?</strong></p>

<p>Laptops are recommended if you’re interested in playing the CTF or crypto challenge. If you’re interested in career opportunities, we’d recommend bringing a hard copy of your resume.</p>

<p><strong>How can I contact the organizer with any questions?</strong></p>

<p>You can email info at bsidesroc.com if you have any questions.</p>

<h1 id="-cat-codeofconduct">$ cat CodeOfConduct</h1>

<p>One of the goals we have with BSidesROC is to foster open discussion between attendees, speakers, and staff. Expressing radical viewpoints is welcome, and a high degree of skepticism on all sides is expected. Regardless, we aim to make BSidesROC a safe environment for everyone. We hold to the hacker ethos that what you look like is not important, your brain is what matters. As such, insulting or harassing other participants is unacceptable. We do not condone harassment against any participant, for any reason. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation, and targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel unwelcome, or afraid – it does not include expressing viewpoints in a civil manner, even if they run contrary to the views others hold.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including – but not limited to – expulsion from the event without refund, and referral to the relevant authorities.</p>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating at BSidesROC – whether they are attendees, speakers, press, volunteers, or staff.</p>

<p>Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact any BSidesROC staff or volunteer – identified by their unique shirt, and radio. Our staff will be happy to help attendees contact local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.</p>
