				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re really excited about the keynote speaker for BSides Roc 2016:  <a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/nate-cardozo" target="_blank">Nate Cardozo</a> of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/about/" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_1621" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/nate-cardozo" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-1621"><img class="wp-image-1621 size-medium" src="https://www.bsidesroc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cardozo-200x300.jpg" alt="Nate Cardozo, Staff Attorney for the EFF. Photographed by Erich Valo." width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Erich Valo Photography</em></p></div>
<p>Nate is a Senior Staff Attorney on the EFF&#8217;s digital civil liberties team. In addition to his focus on free speech and privacy litigation, Nate works on EFF&#8217;s cryptography policy and the Coders&#8217; Rights Project. Nate has projects involving export controls on software, state-sponsored malware, automotive privacy, government transparency, hardware hacking rights, anonymous speech, electronic privacy law reform, Freedom of Information Act litigation, and resisting the expansion of the surveillance state. A 2009-2010 EFF Open Government Legal Fellow, Nate has a B.A. in Anthropology and Politics from U.C. Santa Cruz and a J.D. from U.C. Hastings.</p>
<p>Nate tells us in his preview of his talk, &#8220;Strong end-to-end encryption is legal in the United States today, thanks to our victory in what&#8217;s come to be known as the Crypto Wars of the 1990s. But in the wake of Paris and San Bernardino, there is increasing pressure from law enforcement and policy makers, both here and abroad, to mandate so-called backdoors in encryption products. In this presentation, I will discuss in brief the history of the first Crypto Wars, and the state of the law coming into 2016. I will then discuss the current proposals to weaken or ban encryption, covering proposed and recently enacted laws in New York, California, Australia, India, and the UK. Finally, I will discuss possible realistic outcomes to the Second Crypto Wars, and give my predictions on what the State of the Law will be at the end of 2016.  Obviously, the content may well change, based on what Magistrate Judge Pym does in San Bernardino!!!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard about our brand new event this year?</p>
<h2 lang="en">Resumelee!</h2>
<p>For BSidesROC 2016 we are trying something new, facilitate matching up hackers to employers that are looking to hire them. The premise is simple: submit your résumé to us, and we will provide it to interested companies that want to recruit you. Even better: we’re working to have a panel of experienced security industry professionals and recruiters that can provide objective critique of the résumé you submit, so you can improve your chances of scoring a great job at a cool company.</p>
<p>So how does “melee” come into play? Rather than just accepting boring paper or electronic versions of résumés, we are asking you to get creative and provide them to us in the craziest format possible. Have you ever been told by an employer that they only accept résumés in PDF, Word, or online format? Now is your chance to get revenge. Want to spray paint your résumé onto a board? No problem. Feel like knitting a résumé out of yak fur? Seems itchy…but OK.</p>
