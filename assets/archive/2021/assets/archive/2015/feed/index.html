				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re excited to finally be able to announce the food options for this year&#8217;s BSidesROC. We&#8217;ve teamed up with the folks at <a href="http://butapub.com/" target="_blank">ButAPub</a> to make sure all you hackers have delicious food to eat, that won&#8217;t cost a million dollars. Not only did they step up to the challenge, they even created a unique menu item specifically for BSidesROC!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have the usual sandwiches (turkey, roast beef, ham), and breakfast items (fruit, yogurt, breakfast sandwich). There&#8217;ll be a Vietnamese inspired banh mi sandwich. But the coolest thing (in our opinion) is the special Ramen dish they created for us. It comes with pork shoulder, veggies, a 62 degree egg &amp; noodles, but the best part is that it&#8217;s served in a 32oz mason jar!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be posting a pre-order link very soon, to help finagle the logistics of getting ~300 people food all at the same time. Keep an eye out for that if you want to skip lines. Until then, you can check out the full menu at our <a href="http://www.bsidesroc.com/venue/food/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that we&#8217;ll be running an SDR workshop this year &#8211; presented by Jon Szymaniak – one of the developers from Nuand&#8217;s BladeRF, and Alex Page our local <span class="il">SDR</span> guru and PHD student.</p>
<p>In last year&#8217;s SDR workshop, we gave lots of examples of projects you could do with RTLSDR, and pointed to the software you could use to do them. However, we didn&#8217;t have time to get into the details of that software, or explain any radio theory. This year, we are expanding the SDR workshop into a longer, more comprehensive session to cover those topics.</p>
<p>To start, we&#8217;ll talk about radio fundamentals: bandwidth, sampling, modulation, coding, etc. This will provide you with enough background to understand how things communicate using RF. Then, we will move on to an example application using gnuradio and other tools. You will follow along with your own laptop and SDR as we reverse-engineering something wireless and then &#8211; if your SDR can transmit &#8211; mess with it.</p>
<p>In a bit of a change for us, we&#8217;re going to be charging for this workshop. If you have your own SDR, your ticket to the class is 5 bucks, which gets you the training, as well as a CD-ROM filled with scripts, tools, and various other software to help you hack all the Hz. If you don&#8217;t have an SDR yet, we have a registration option that gets you all that, plus 1 RTLSDR. The cost for that ticket is $25.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, you should register soon &#8211; the class is limited to 30 seats. Registration is at http://rocsdr2015.eventzilla.net/</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, if you&#8217;ve registered for the con already, you may have noticed that there were no food options. (If you haven&#8217;t registered yet, you should <a href="http://bsidesroc2015.eventzilla.net" target="_blank">go do that now</a>, then come back to this).  We figure it&#8217;s probably a good idea to let you folks know what&#8217;s going on with food this year, so, here we are.</p>
<p>The first three years we ran BSidesROC, we bought food for everyone. Pizza (that sucked) the first year, then subs the next two years (better than the pizza, but not by much).  Last year we switched venues, and had to buy food as part of the contract. Those that wanted to buy in to that food (taco bar), were able to. For the rest of you, we summoned a couple of food trucks and set up space in the parking lot for them. Most people went that route. This mostly worked, but was a giant PITA to manage, and cost us a ton (for the venue food).</p>
<p>This year, we&#8217;re taking a different approach. We&#8217;re letting the venue handle food entirely on its own, and not worrying about it from our side at all.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakfast will be available for purchase directly from the venue</li>
<li>Lunch will be available for purchase directly from the venue</li>
<li>Lunch will also be available via food trucks in the parking lot again</li>
<li>If you hate the thought of buying from the venue, or food trucks, there are quite a few options within walking distance &#8211; feel free to hit them up.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to take a peek at the kinds of food the venue offers, their menus are <a href="http://butapub.com/the-food/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;re a little unsure of the logisitcs around delivery (200+ people all ordering food at the same time seems like a good way to DoS a kitchen to us). We&#8217;ve talked with the venue about that, and come up with a plan. We will have a link posted that will let folks pre-order the food they want, thus &#8220;skipping the line&#8221; and avoiding backlog. Stay tuned to the venue section of the website for that.</p>
<p>We think that this will work out well for everyone, and if it turns out to suck, we&#8217;ll revisit the plan next year =)</p>
