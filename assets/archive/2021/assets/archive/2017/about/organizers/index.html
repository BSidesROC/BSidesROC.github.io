<h2 id="bsidesroc-the-organization">BSidesROC – The Organization</h2>

<p>Security BSidesROC is run by volunteers; people that feel the need to help create a hacker conference in Rochester so strongly that they give up weekends and free time to make it happen.</p>

<p>We help divide up the workload by making “Op” positions for the various facets of the conference. Ops are in charge of keeping track of their project’s money, managing the volunteers that help them, and coming up with awesome ways to get things done.</p>

<p><strong>Alex Page</strong></p>

<p>Alex is a data scientist at URMC. His work involves database tuning, machine learning, and parallel programming, but in his spare time, he prefers to play with software defined radios and geologically defined rocks. He has assisted in the last four BSidesROC events, but will be out of town for 2017 due to unforeseen adulthood.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hacker Store Acquisitions Op</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bill &ldquo;JustBill&rdquo; Bukowski (Director)</strong></p>

<p>JustBill brings expert level knowledge in the latest enterprise technology to the group. He is a “Manager” of IT for the largest market research company in the world. He no longer needs to actually know things but make sure you have your management slide ready for him just in case he cares. He has a background in Ham radio, and enjoys hacking all things RF related. He denies that he is a hacker, but if you talk to him for more than a minute you’ll see he’s wrong or just confused.</p>

<ul>
<li>Resumelee Op</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chaim</strong></p>

<p>Chaim is professor of Computing Security at the Rochester Institute of Technology and also works for ZeroFOX. He is a security aficionado most often recognizable by his relative tallness. When he is not busy being overly cynical about the state of computing security, he is generally interested in many areas of security research ranging from physical security to secure software development life cycles. Currently most of his research tends to focus around web application security where he co-leads the Open Source ModSecurity project and leads the OWASP Core Ruleset Project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Venue Op</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>chorn</strong></p>

<p>chorn is freelance demotivational speaker. He likes unwarranted wiretaps and irony. He writes code that other people don’t hate. He’s a serial organizer, volunteer, collaborator, and hugger. He’s probably wrong so don’t let him get away with anything.</p>

<ul>
<li>Volunteer Op</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Jenn Gates</strong></p>

<p>This is Jenn&rsquo;s second year volunteering for BSidesROC. Although she is no longer in Rochester physically, she remains there in spirit&hellip; unless it snows.. then her spirit is on the beach.</p>

<ul>
<li>Resumelee Op</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Joe Testa (Director)</strong></p>

<p>Mr. Testa is a man of many names – friends call him Cowboy Joe, or the SeCowboi. Joe has been an infosec professional for much of his career. He started out as a developer of Rapid 7’s Nexpose vulnerability scanner, where he quickly learned the ins-and-outs of network exploitation. Since then, Joe has since gone out on to own to operate his own Rochester-based security company, <a href="http://www.positronsecurity.com/">Positron Security</a>.</p>

He is an active member of the Rochester hacker community including Rochester 2600, Interlock Rochester, and TOOOL Rochester.</p>

He is a Buffalo native and works for a large financial institution. He also has a Master’s degree in Digital Forensic Science from Champlain College.</p>

<ul>
<li>Assist To Mr. 80 Op</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mitch &ldquo;Skirmit&rdquo; Skinner</strong></p>

<p>A recent grad and shady local who just kinda showed up at 2600 one day and stuck around. He works defense by day and goes home to exploit software at night. When he&rsquo;s AFK, you&rsquo;ll likely find him clearing his biological cache with nature, shooting targets, or at a dive bar watching some underground metal band.</p>

<ul>
<li>Volunteer Op</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ryan &ldquo;HoopyCat&rdquo; Tucker</strong></p>

<p>By day, Ryan is a freelance electrical and software engineer, specializing in FPGA design and firmware development. By night, they deploy a unique set of skills to keep organizations such as Interlock Rochester and RocWiki running. On weekends, you’ll see them participating in a rally race, looking very cat-like at a furry convention, on the streets fighting fascists, or cuddled up with a romantic partner.</p>

<li>DJ/PA Op</li>

<p><strong>Vlad Ionescu</strong></p>

He likes vim, bash, i3, radios and antennas, stealing secrets from embedded devices, and lane splitting on motorcycles. Vlad is fighting to bring back the 90s hacker scene in San Francisco, and lurks on BSidesROC&rsquo;s digital channels in his spare time.</p>
