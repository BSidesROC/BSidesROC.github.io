|  Hulto | Goofkit - Getting goofy with kernel functions  |  Two easy techniques to make your rootkit stealthier and more robust! Goofkit is a new Linux Kernel Module (LKM) rootkit being released. It uses both inline hooking and trampolining to create a more robust, and stealthy rootkit. This talk will cover how traditional LKM rootkits are made, what can be done better, and why. This talk is aimed at those who are interested in building a rootkit, looking to improve their own, or just learn more about how Linux works. |  20 Minute | Hulto is a student who's trying to learn about security and share a little bit in the process.  |
|  Matt Metzger |  SMS MFA MITM WTF | Have you ever compromised someone's account that was protected with SMS based MFA and thought "Hey, this is a nice account, I wish I had some way of maintaining access to it"? Are you the only kid on your block without Signaling System 7 access to hijack SMS messages? Does social engineering a telco into a SIM swap attack just seem like too much work? I have a new tool for you!  |  20 Minute |  Matt Metzger is an Application Security Engineer at Stitch Fix.

|  Mike Lisi |  What I’ve Learned About Students by Running a CTF | This is a talk geared toward students looking to get into the information security field. As an infosec professional and designer of a student-focused Capture the Flag competition held each semester for the past five years, I've had the opportunity to gather information about which areas in information security that students have shown strength in and where they've lacked some essential skills. I'll discuss these areas and suggest resources that students can use to supplement their course curriculum to help position them better for internships and a job after graduation.  |  20 Minute |  Mike Lisi is a Senior Consultant at HALOCK Security Labs and a co-founder of the hacker meetup group IthacaSec. Before hacking full time, Mike worked as a network administrator, a programmer/analyst, and a developer of offensive and defensive DoD technologies. Mike received a BS in Computer Science from SUNY Poly as well as a handful of infosec certifications. Mike is the lead designer for the CNY Hackathon CTF, a security competition for students held each semester in Utica, NY. |
