    title: DMARC-y Mark and Phishy Bunch
    abstract: Despite all the investments and implementations of anti-phishing solutions, DPRK threat actors are easily bypassing these measures by exploiting organizations missing DMARC policies. In this session, I'll provide an overview on the importance of implementing a DMARC policy, showcase inauthentic email samples that spoofed legitimate orgs, as well as reveal an on-going campaign by a North Korean nation-state actor that's leveraging poor DMARC practices at think tanks, NGOs, and other government-affiliated entities to successfully target experts involved in Korean affairs, SEAsian affairs, and nuclear non-proliferation efforts. Lastly, you'll learn the basics of properly configuring SPF/DKIM/DMARC policies, and strategies for working with your IT teams to implement these changes.

    title: "Styrofoam in a Landfill: CVSS Never Changes"
    abstract: The days of “patch all the things” or “just patch the criticals” is over. These old practices no longer serve modern enterprise environments well. Zero days are now a common monthly and sometimes weekly occurrence, non-zero days are being weaponized faster than ever, and attackers continue to develop malware and exploits for old CVEs. Yet CVSS scores NEVER change. We have to change our methods, processes, and mindset to keep up.

    title: "Microsoft at your BEC and (API) Call: Auditing Mailbox Item Access for Incident Response"
    abstract: Concerned about business email compromise (BEC) attacks? Until recently, organizations using Office 365 for email had no way to audit access to individual mailbox items unless they paid for the premium E5-level license. Under intense pressure, Microsoft has enabled all customers to access these logs - but accessing them and getting the data into an actionable format is still a daunting task. In this talk I'll show how you can leverage readily-available technologies to pull the mailbox audit logs into your SIEM and datalake solution, giving visibility into individual mailbox item access logs, and potentially reducing your PHI/PII exposure risk in the event of a cybersecurity incident.

    title: Active Directory ain’t going anywhere, so we might as well secure it
    abstract: Despite the hopes and dreams of moving to a cloud-centric identity, the reality is Active Directory (AD) is not retiring anytime soon for the organizations that use it. The complexities of how woven into the fabric of a business Active Directory is will put the brakes on even the most ambitious cloud-centric modernization programs. And while Active Directory tends to receive no love from the business, it certainly does from the threat actors – Mandiant has reported that 90% of all breaches they investigate involve Active Directory. Since things are not changing anytime soon, we might as well give AD a little bit of the security TLC. In this session we’ll explore the most common blockers preventing organizations from parting ways with Active Directory. And since this staple directory service is sticking around, we’ll look at the most common threat patterns against Active Directory, and the critical security controls to help keep our users and business secure for as long as AD is here to stay.
