    abstract: "As electric vehicles become more and more common, so does Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment, or EV chargers. These devices exist in a complex ecosystem almost completely independent of the traditional electric grid, leaving their security the responsibility of the individual owners/operators. In this presentation, we will examine how EVSE is vulnerable at both the endpoint and network level, often through well-understood vectors such as stack-based buffer overflows and man-in-the-middle attacks. We will also discuss CVE opportunities for ambitious students and researchers, and steps that asset owners can take to secure their equipment and networks. Finally, we will examine evsetool, a Python utility developed by the author to send, intercept and decode OCPP 1.6 traffic, in order to enable attacks such as unauthorized charge session access and malicious firmware update."

    abstract: "DevOps? DevSecOps? We might as well call it DevSecMarketingHvacJanitorialOps - because the term 'DevSecOps' misses that DevOps already encompasses security, along with all other business concerns. It is a unifying theory of the way we work, including the way we secure our work, more effectively. Ethan Witherington has spent years studying the history and underlying principles of DevSecOps, and has come to a controversial conclusion - Engineers should be able to self-approve PRs to prod (and there are 35 prods) (and each prod is an F500's SOC). This talk will start with historical context, dive into the theory of constraints, and explore all the reasons why such a safety-for-speed tradeoff is worthwhile (along with the other compensating controls to re-introduce security to the system)."
