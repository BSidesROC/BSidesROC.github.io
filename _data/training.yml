            Tactics (APT28) is an intermediate-level course that focuses on executing Advanced Persistent
            Threat (APT) Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) using Empire. In this hands-on course, students will
            evaluate the 2021-2022 exploitation campaign from Fancy Bear (APT 28) using MSHTML RCE (CVE-2021-40444)
            in macro-enabled docs, OneDrive C2 communications, and C# payloads. Next, attendees will learn the individual
            components of Empire and how to apply them to execute a red team operation. Key topics that will be taught are
            building C2 infrastructure, deploying customized payloads in C# and PowerShell, and creating tailored scripts for
            engagements. Finally, the Empire TTPs learned throughout the course will be tested on a comprehensive range using
            an emulation plan provided on APT 28. Hardware/Software Requirements - Laptop with 8GB of RAM and Modern Web
            Browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc).
