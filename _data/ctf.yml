        Our team at MetaCTF is excited to run the Capture the Flag competition at BSidesROC this year! Our jeopardy-style CTF will have plenty of challenges for participants at all skill levels, so whether you're a seasoned CTF player or a beginner, there will be something for you! CTFs are a great way to learn, and our goal is for you to walk away with some new tools, techniques, and skills. You'll need a laptop to participate. Teams can have up to 4 people, or you may compete as an individual. If you'd like to come prepared, check out practice CTF challenges and solutions at [https://mctf.io/practice](https://mctf.io/practice).
        
        MetaCTF is a startup specializing in hands-on and engaging cybersecurity training for users of all skill levels. If you're interested in helping out with CTFs or hosting one at your company, please contact roman@metactf.com.
