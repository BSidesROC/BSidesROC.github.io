TOOOL Rochester is the local chapter of the Open Organization Of Lockpickers.  It is a loosely knit group of people from varying backgrounds that meet to share information about physical security such as lock picking.  TOOOL will be running a "lock pick village" at BSidesROC, teaching lockpicking and also challenging you with some trickier locks.  You are invited to bring your own locks to try to pick as well!
