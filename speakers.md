Alyssa Miller is a hacker who, in her pre-teens, bought her first computer and hacked her way into a paid dial-up 
community platform. She grew up in hacker culture, finding her hacker family in IRC channels during her adolescent 
years. While IT was not her original career plan, she ended up working as a developer and later a penetration tester in
the financial services industry. As she moved into consulting, her focus on defending technology systems and personal 
privacy grew to the point where she was advising fortune 100 companies on how to build comprehensive security programs.

Alyssa now in an executive role as the CISO of Epiq Global. Still very much a hacker to this day, she’s built on that
identity to grow her career. She is an internationally recognized public speaker and author of 
“Cybersecurity Career Guide”. She’s an advocate for helping others make a career out of their passion for hacking and
security in general. She’s also a proponent for the open sharing of ideas and perspectives on improving our 
technologically connected world.
