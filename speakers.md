# Zach Bevilacqua
 
I am a security engineer who built detection methods
and response tactics for a fortune 60 company, as well as penetration
testing on access controls and authentication methods for hosted
services. I have technical interests in malware analysis and reverse
engineering. My main goal in my career is to make sure we solve actual
problems at their source and not tend to the symptoms. It's my hope to
be able to transfer my knowledge to other people in some way that it's
helpful to them. Dogs are cool but cats are better.
