Hacker, InfoSec, Safety, CyberStuff Researcher, Advisor, @Hacknotcrime henchman, and various other names on the technical side of the world vCISO, Executive, consultant, leadership, and other words that have been leveled against me describing some of the other work undertaken over the years.

I’ve been fortunate to be elbow deep in technology for more years than I care to remember, and these days am involved in both tactical and strategic discussions with clients across the spectrum of industries talking maturity, risk, and how to effect change.

Oh, and I just got called a Scottish Security Warlock....I’m kinda digging it.
