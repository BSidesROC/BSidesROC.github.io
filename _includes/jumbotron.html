            In her keynote, Alyssa Miller will share her origin story of how she navigated a journey from a 4 year-old
            who loved
            taking things apart, to a teen with a passion for technology, through her various roles in tech, and now
            finds herself
            in the C-Suite. She’ll tell the tales of crazy hacks, serendipitous opportunities, and the lessons she
            learned along
            the journey. You’ll learn how she tries to use her presence as a hacker in the boardroom, to normalize and
            pave the way
            for hackers to follow the same route.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alyssa will discuss lessons that can be applied throughout your own career journey. She'll share the key to
            successfully
            entering the community, thriving in growth, and achieving heights you may never have thought possible.
            You'll leave this
            session inspired to use your authenticity to pave your success with all the vigor of a 12 year-old hacker.
