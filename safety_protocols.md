# COVID-19 INFORMATION

The BSidesROC Board values the health and safety of participants and staff. As part of our return to a physical venue, 
we continue to evaluate the current situation as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic. The following details our safety 
policy regarding the pandemic. All participants of BSidesROC must wear a mask in order to attend the conference.

## MASKS REQUIRED

We are requiring the wearing of a mask.

Masks requirements include:
* Mask should be a solid, multi-layer piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, or punctures.
* A properly worn mask completely covers the nose and mouth and is well-fitted.
* May contain filter pockets or sleeves.
* Medical masks and N-95 respirators fulfill the requirements.

The following do not fulfill the mask requirements:
* Face shields or goggles (unless to supplement a proper and properly worn mask)
* Scarves, ski masks, balaclavas, or bandannas
* Shirt or sweater collars pulled up over the mouth and nose.
* Masks made from loosely woven or knitted fabrics that let light pass through
* Masks made from non porous or too dense materials (such as vinyl, plastic or leather)
* Masks that do not fit properly

Consistent failure to wear an approved mask can result in ejection for the conference and a ban on returning until after
the pandemic. We do understand that these changes might be frustrating, and being reminded to adhere to them can be 
embarrassing or offensive. However, these measures and the reminders to follow these measures are for everyoneâ€™s 
protection.

If a staff member reminds you to adjust your mask so it fits over your nose, please know that this is for your safety. 
Verbal abuse towards BSidesROC staff, volunteers, or hotel staff will result in ejection from the conference.

Any threats of physical or nonphysical retaliation with regard to our COVID-19 policies, or other policies, will result 
in ejection from the conference, as well as a lifetime ban to the conference. Law enforcement will be alerted as needed.

We all look forward to having everyone at the conference and hope to see you there!
