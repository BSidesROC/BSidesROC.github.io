The health and safety of BSidesROC participants remain a top priority for conference organizers. BSidesROC will continue
to monitor the guidance of NYS, Monroe County, and the CDC regarding appropriate safety measures as the conference date
nears. As of January 2024, BSidesROC will not require proof of vaccination nor masks at the 2024 conference. While
continuously monitoring the situation, organizers will reserve the right to change this policy at any time if conditions
warrant it, including up to the start date of the conference. Masks and vaccines are strongly encouraged at BSidesROC, 
but are not required at this time.
