# Code of Conduct

One of the goals we have with BSidesROC is to foster open discussion between attendees, speakers, and staff. Expressing radical viewpoints is welcome, and a high degree of skepticism on all sides is expected. Regardless, we aim to make BSidesROC a safe environment for everyone. We hold to the hacker ethos that what you look like is not important, your brain is what matters. As such, insulting or harassing other participants is unacceptable. We do not condone harassment against any participant, for any reason. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation, and targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel unwelcome, or afraid – it does not include expressing viewpoints in a civil manner, even if they run contrary to the views others hold.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including – but not limited to – expulsion from the event without refund, and referral to the relevant authorities.

This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating at BSidesROC – whether they are attendees, speakers, press, volunteers, or staff.

Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact any BSidesROC staff or volunteer – identified by their unique shirt, and radio. Our staff will be happy to help attendees contact local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.
