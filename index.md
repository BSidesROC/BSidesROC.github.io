Security B-Sides Rochester, or BSidesROC, is an open, non-profit hacker conference in Rochester, NY. It provides a place for people to learn about hacking, infosec, and all kinds of different technology in a fun environment.

Our seventh year was another action packed event that included presentations from industry professionals, games and challenges that exercised your hacker skills, as well as community involvement that represents the Rochester community. We helped students and employers match up to see if we canâ€™t turn the amateur hacker into a career plan.

This year's BSidesRoc will be held at the RIT Inn at 5257 West Henrietta Road, Henrietta, NY 14467 on <strong>March 23rd</strong>.
