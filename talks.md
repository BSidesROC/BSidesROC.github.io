| *Presenter*  | *Title*     | *Description* | *Time* |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| *Nick Roy* | OSINT and the Hermit Kingdom. Leveraging online sources to learn more about the worlds’ most secret nation | OSINT tools provide security analysts with a powerful set of tools and data that can be leveraged to discover accounts, infrastructure, and long forgotten services that are still running. Using these sources we can research specific companies or users, find easy targets for bug bounties, and begin reconnaissance efforts against our own systems. Learn more about different techniques to gather information while examining North Korea’s public facing infrastructure and their state sponsored operating system. |  50 minutes  |
| *Mark Maning* | Command and KubeCTL: Real-World Pentesting of Kubernetes Environments | Kubernetes is a security challenge that many organizations need to take on and we as pentesters, developers, security practitioners, and the technically curious need to adapt to these challenges. In this talk we will look at tactics, techniques, and tools to assess and exploit Kubernetes clusters. We will demonstrate how to intercept service mesh traffic, evade runtime syscall filters, exploit custom sidecars, and chain attacks that go from compromising a build environment, to exploiting production applications. We’ll cover real world attack paths, provide practical advice, and guidance using the experience of conducting hundreds of reviews of containerized environments while running NCC Group’s container research group.           |  50 minutes  |
| *Ravi Devineni* | Automating Security Compliance at Scale | Information security and compliance are becoming critical to businesses, especially after the Equifax breach. Financial services companies are no longer willing to compromise on security, especially when deploying services onto the cloud. In this talk, you'll learn a few techniques which we've implemented to automate compliance and use fast feedback loops to implement security as a part of software delivery process. | 20 minutes|
| *Qasim Ijaz* | Hacking Healthcare | Healthcare industry has seen a drastic increase in ransomware attacks, insider threat, and advanced persistent threats over past decade. From 37.5 million records being stolen at Anthem to our local hospitals being taken down by ransomware, we are seeing healthcare IT vulnerabilities come to light. In this talk, I present a methodology for identifying and exploiting healthcare IT vulnerabilities. I will talk about common areas of concern I continue to come across during our penetration tests, provide a checklist for 10-minute domain admin, and share insights on how the industry is innovating to combat cybersecurity threats. | 50 minutes |
| *Tom Cappetta* | SecDevOps@Cuse - CyberRange: An Open-Source Offensive/Defensive Security Lab in AWS | This CyberRange project represents the first open-source Cyber Range blueprint in the world. This project provides a bootstrap framework for a complete offensive, defensive, reverse engineering, and security intelligence tooling in a private research lab using the AWS Cloud. This project contains vulnerable systems, open-source tools.  It simply provides a researcher with a disposable offensive/defensive AWS-based environment in less than 10 minutes. | 50 minutes |
| *Zach Bevilacqua* | Malware Analysis in Real Life | A look into what analyzing malware, maldocs, and overall anything suspicious is like in actual response scenarios. You don't need to be fluent in assembly to derive techniques and generate IOC's for your organization. We will work out what that type of analysis looks like and some best practices and techniques when handling malicious content.Hopefully, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how little it takes to setup a space to safely do this and how quickly you'll be able to generate indicators and intelligence proactively. | 50 minutes |
| *Greg Stachura* | Forensics – not just for the wealthy | The complexity of attack’s continues to grow and understanding root-cause can be critical to keeping out attackers. Forensics can be key in root-cause analysis, but tools like Encase and FTK typically cause sticker shock to personal users, and small to medium businesses. This talk will explore building a forensic program using free and open source tools. Whether you just bought a used Xbox drive off ebay, or you have a laptop riddle with malware, you can grab your go bag and get some answers. | 50 minutes |
| *Joe Sarkisian* | JUST JUMP! Lessons for Wannabe Social Engineers by a Recent Wannabe Social Engineer | Social Engineering is both the easiest and hardest part of the wider security field to enter; easy in that it doesn't always require lots of technical knowledge, and hard because it can be absolutely terrifying to start. As someone who knows this feeling, works in the field, and has been forced to make it up as they go (with a little help from some amazing people), I'd like to talk a bit about lessons learned as I began my journey. Lessons like: 1. The simplest ways to get started in the field 2. Overcoming fear (and understanding it will never truly go away) 3. The starter social engineer 'kit bag' 4. Why planning can sometimes be your worst enemy 5. Realizing there are skills you already have that will help you 6. How to stay safe | 50 minutes |
