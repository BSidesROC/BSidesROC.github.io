| [*Nick Roy*](/speakers#nick-roy) | OSINT and the Hermit Kingdom. Leveraging online sources to learn more about the worlds’ most secret nation | OSINT tools provide security analysts with a powerful set of tools and data that can be leveraged to discover accounts, infrastructure, and long forgotten services that are still running. Using these sources we can research specific companies or users, find easy targets for bug bounties, and begin reconnaissance efforts against our own systems. Learn more about different techniques to gather information while examining North Korea’s public facing infrastructure and their state sponsored operating system. |  50 minutes  |

| [*Brian Callahan*](/speakers#brian-callahan) | The education of hacking: A year of teaching all the things | Cybersecurity majors are being increasingly offered at colleges and universities across the United States. This is in addition to the many informal and corporate-sponsored routes towards cybersecurity education. This talk explores two formal cybersecurity courses offered at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute: the flagship Information Systems Security course as well as a new course named Modern Binary Exploitation. These two courses provide us a tale of two approaches: one formally designed by a professor and the other originally developed and taught by students. We will examine what worked, what didn't, future plans for these two courses and the potential for future courses and cybersecurity activities at RPI. We will conclude with strategies for students and teachers to get the most out of their cybersecurity education, regardless of its source. | 50 minutes |
| [*Matt Arnold*](/speakers#matt-arnold) | OpenBSD Server Side | An Introduction the OpenBSD Web Server environment, including frontend technologies such httpd(8), relayd(8), acme-client(1), . And how these technologies use OpenBSD's proactive security features like pledge,, unveil and others, to stop or mitigate common exploits. | 50 minutes |
| [*Chloé Messdaghi*](/speakers/#chloé-messdaghi) | The Hacker Hippocampus: Meet your brain on games | Always on the edge of your seat when it comes to new exploits and tricks. From bug bounties, CTFs, live hacking events, simulations, and interactive educational modules, they have been proven to stimulate and enforce new tools and knowledge to become stronger red teamers, blue teamers, and purple teamers. But how did gamification come into play and in infosec? And how does our brain process gamification and threats as hackers? This gamified/interactive talk shares the history of gamification in infosec, how our brains are stimulated by them, and how it's transforming lives. | 50 minutes | 
| [*Joe Sarkisian*](/speakers/#joe-sarkisian) | JUST JUMP! Lessons for Wannabe Social Engineers by a Recent Wannabe Social Engineer |  Social Engineering is both the easiest and hardest part of the wider security field to enter; easy in that it doesn't always require lots of technical knowledge, and hard because it can be absolutely terrifying to start. As someone who knows this feeling, works in the field, and has been forced to make it up as they go (with a little help from some amazing people) | 50 minutes |
