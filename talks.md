| *Presenter*  | *Title*     | *Description* | *Time* |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| *Nick Roy* | OSINT and the Hermit Kingdom. Leveraging online sources to learn more about the worlds’ most secret nation | OSINT tools provide security analysts with a powerful set of tools and data that can be leveraged to discover accounts, infrastructure, and long forgotten services that are still running. Using these sources we can research specific companies or users, find easy targets for bug bounties, and begin reconnaissance efforts against our own systems. Learn more about different techniques to gather information while examining North Korea’s public facing infrastructure and their state sponsored operating system. |  50 minutes  |
| *Mark Maning* | Command and KubeCTL: Real-World Pentesting of Kubernetes Environments | Kubernetes is a security challenge that many organizations need to take on and we as pentesters, developers, security practitioners, and the technically curious need to adapt to these challenges. In this talk we will look at tactics, techniques, and tools to assess and exploit Kubernetes clusters. We will demonstrate how to intercept service mesh traffic, evade runtime syscall filters, exploit custom sidecars, and chain attacks that go from compromising a build environment, to exploiting production applications. We’ll cover real world attack paths, provide practical advice, and guidance using the experience of conducting hundreds of reviews of containerized environments while running NCC Group’s container research group.           |  50 minutes  |
| *Ravi Devineni* | Automating Security Compliance at Scale | Information security and compliance are becoming critical to businesses, especially after the Equifax breach. Financial services companies are no longer willing to compromise on security, especially when deploying services onto the cloud. In this talk, you'll learn a few techniques which we've implemented to automate compliance and use fast feedback loops to implement security as a part of software delivery process. | 20 minutes|
| *Qasim Ijaz* | Hacking Healthcare | Healthcare industry has seen a drastic increase in ransomware attacks, insider threat, and advanced persistent threats over past decade. From 37.5 million records being stolen at Anthem to our local hospitals being taken down by ransomware, we are seeing healthcare IT vulnerabilities come to light. In this talk, I present a methodology for identifying and exploiting healthcare IT vulnerabilities. I will talk about common areas of concern I continue to come across during our penetration tests, provide a checklist for 10-minute domain admin, and share insights on how the industry is innovating to combat cybersecurity threats. | 50 minutes |
| *Tom Cappetta* | SecDevOps@Cuse - CyberRange: An Open-Source Offensive/Defensive Security Lab in AWS | This CyberRange project represents the first open-source Cyber Range blueprint in the world. This project provides a bootstrap framework for a complete offensive, defensive, reverse engineering, and security intelligence tooling in a private research lab using the AWS Cloud. This project contains vulnerable systems, open-source tools.  It simply provides a researcher with a disposable offensive/defensive AWS-based environment in less than 10 minutes. | 50 minutes |
