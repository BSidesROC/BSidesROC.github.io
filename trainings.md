Investigating with Splunk

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Instructor: Robert Wagner

Investigating with Splunk is a modular, hands-on workshop designed to
familiarize participants with how to investigate incidents using Splunk and open
source. This workshop provides users a way to gain experience searching in
Splunk to answer specific questions related to an investigation. These questions
are similar to what would be asked in their own organizations. Users will leave
with a better understanding of how logs can be used to investigate incidents in
their enterprise.

If you don't have any Splunk experience, you can take the following free on-line
class to prepare for this workshop:
