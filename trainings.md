OSINT:

In this 4-hour Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) workshop, taught by a
passionate social engineer and DerbyCon Black Badge recipient for the
Social Engineering Capture the Flag with a proven OSINT track record,
we will begin with a fundamental understanding of OSINT. We will also
discuss the legal and ethical considerations of collection and
destruction of OSINT data. From here, we will discuss the offensive
and defensive applications of OSINT information. In the next modules,
we will discuss “People OSINT” and “Business OSINT” as they relate to
offensive attacks. We will wrap up with a discussion about defending
against OSINT collection via data minimization, disinformation, and
deceptive techniques.

Splunk:

Investigating with Splunk is a modular, hands-on workshop designed to
familiarize participants with how to investigate incidents using
Splunk and open source. This workshop provides users a way to gain
experience searching in Splunk to answer specific questions related to
an investigation. These questions are similar to what would be asked
in their own organizations. Users will leave with a better
understanding of how logs can be used to investigate incidents in
their enterprise.

Pentesting:

Coalfire's 1-day Pivot into Penetration Testing class is an immersive
course that will provide practical experience and a solid framework
for conducting in-depth penetration tests in enterprise environments.
