CTF Boot Camp: 

A beginner CTF event where basic penetration testing skills will be
taught in order to enumerate machines, search for vulnerabilities,
find and customize exploits, and finally gain the highest level of
access on each machine. After the course, be sure to test your new
skills in the BSidesROC CTF!

Requirements: a Kali linux machine or virtual image

OSINT:

This course, taught by a member of the 2nd Place team at HackFest Missing
Persons CTF, is designed to hone specifically in on the processes and tools used
to perform "People OSINT" in situations where investigators are seeking to find
missing people, some of which do not want to be found. This focuses on
validating the information discovered and using it to pivot to valuable
information, in both a CTF setting (such as Trace Labs' CTFs
-https://www.tracelabs.org/getinvolved/ctf/) and law enforcement.  This class is
for anyone from an absolute beginner in OSINT and Missing person investigations
all the way up to seasoned law enforcement and beyond.

In this 4-hour class, you will learn:

 * The fundamental basics of OSINT
 * The basis of People OSINT
 * Positive Uses
 * Negative Uses
 * Information relative to the "OSINT Heartbeat" in terms of expanding, collecting, synthesizing, and contracting based on intelligence: Friends, Employers, Family, Home Life, Basic Information about the subject, Advanced Information about the subject, Information about the day last seen and circumstances, Current location of the subject
 * People OSINT tools and resources
 * Social media
 * EXIF and Reverse Image search tools
    
At the end of the course, you will participate in a Mini-CTF to apply the concepts you've learned in a collaborative and fun environment.

Requirements: Basic Linux knowledge. Some of the course will require Linux, git,
and Python (python2 and 3, with python-pip and python3-pip installed) whereas
others will only require a web browser. An email with instructions as to which
API Keys and tools will be used will be provided before the event.

Splunk:

Investigating with Splunk is a modular, hands-on workshop designed to
familiarize participants with how to investigate incidents using Splunk and open
source. This workshop provides users a way to gain experience searching in
Splunk to answer specific questions related to an investigation. These questions
are similar to what would be asked in their own organizations. Users will leave
with a better understanding of how logs can be used to investigate incidents in
their enterprise.

If you don't have any Splunk experience, you can take the following free on-line
class to prepare for this workshop:

Requirements: A laptop

Pentesting:

Effective and efficient methodology is often the difference maker for an
effective penetration test. Students will practice Penetration Testing Execution
Standard (PTES) for identifying attack vectors and infiltrating enterprise
environments. We will cover both network and web testing tools and
frameworks. The experience gained in this workshop will enable you to conduct
penetration tests efficiently and effectively against variable target
environments. You will also overcome obstacles, practice modern attack
techniques and learn how to use advanced tactics to force-multiply your
penetration tests. Each step of the methodology has a solid informational
lecture, followed by an in-depth lab or minilab that has the students use the
skills learned in that lecture.

Course outline:

 * Pre-Assessment Activities 
 * Information Gathering 
 * Vulnerability Identification 
 * Offensive Threat Modeling 
 * Gaining Access Through Exploitation 
 * Password Cracking 
 * Reporting 

To get the most from this course, participants should have the following experience:

 * A laptop to run a Kali Linux VM (VMWare Player, VMWare Workstation, or VirtualBox). VMWare Workstation Player is not supported.
 * At least 2+ years with Windows (command-line), Linux, and/or network administration
 * Networking and TCP/IP fundamentals
 * Experience with at least two of basic Batch, PowerShell, Bash, or Python
 * Strong understanding of how HTTP works
 * Experience with web development technologies
 * Basic understanding of OWASP Top 10
 * Experience with VirtualBox/VMWare-Workstation/Fusion. VMWare Workstation Player is not supported.
 * Willingness to learn hands-on in a fast-paced environment
