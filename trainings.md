#### Penetration Testing for Systems and Network Admins

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Length: 8 hours, 8AM - 5PM

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Instructor: Qasim Ijaz

The objective of this Capture-the-Flag style class is to take students with existing networks or systems administration
experience and teach them how to:

        1. Perform a comprehensive penetration test against Active Directory environments.
        2. Spot a bad penetration test. 

We understand that not everyone taking a pen test class will want to be a penetration tester. Hence, we have organized 
this class to be a well-rounded experience, allowing both aspiring red teamers and blue teamers to get the most out of 
it. This class will provide students with hands-on experience with all phases of a penetration test, from information
gathering to reporting.

#### Defense-in-depth Engineering

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Length: 4 hours, 8AM - 12PM

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Instructor: John Poulin

The 2021 OWASP Top Ten introduced a category “Insecure Design” to focus on risks related to design flaws. In this 
training, we will focus on building defense-in-depth software. What can we do to proactively architect software to be
more resilient to attacks? What type of findings may not be discovered via automated static analysis? How can we design
our software to be more friendly during incident response scenarios?

This half day training is perfect for engineers as well as security practitioners that have some familiarity with the 
OWASP top 10. During this training, we will focus on identifying often-overlooked architectural anti-patterns and 
vulnerabilities to be on the lookout for. We will utilize source code review to analyze patterns for improvement in 
both real-world applications as well as intentionally vulnerable applications. Every interactive exercise will involve
discovering concerns and writing code to engineer solutions. The course will wrap up with real-world vulnerability 
analysis of open-source software with an effort to help provide more secure architectural recommendations for these 
projects.

Engineers will leave this training with a solid understanding of defense-in-depth software architecture and design. 
Security engineers or consultants can expect to leave with an increased understanding of insecure design patterns and
vulnerabilities.
