#### A Survey of Linux Forensic Techniques

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Length: 4 hours

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Instructor: Jared Stroud

According to recent industry reports, Linux focused malware has grown in the past year by over 30%. With the rise in 
Cloud Computing it's no surprised that attackers are looking beyond traditional Windows environments to profit off of 
illicit access. Students will be provided with a ""compromised"" disk image in which they will analyze, extract and 
identify IoCs to triage analyze post-compromise activity on the targeted machine. This course will focus on how to 
triage Linux malware, and analyze different ATT&CK mapped TTPs that Linux malware commonly uses. From capturing memory
dumps to network traffic analysis, we'll explore different techniques to enable DFIR response practices in a fun, CTF 
styled environment. Students will be required to bring their own laptops, a Vagrant file will be provided to provision 
the environment (Virtualbox). Experience with Linux command line and introductory experience with x86/x86_64 assembly
recommended.

#### Hands-on Ethical Hacking: Preventing and Writing Exploits for Buffer Overflows.

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Length: 4 hours

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Instructor: Ralph Durkee

A brief but intense hands-on course where you will find a buffer overflow vulnerability and then develop an exploit for
a stack based buffer overflow.  We'll also discuss and test mitigating techniques such as address randomization, stack
protections mechanisms, non-executable stacks and of course programming to prevent buffer overflows.

Laptop Requirements:
• At least 8Gb RAM
• Recent Virtual Box installed to host a LinuxVM.
• Administrator or root privileges for the laptop.

#### Alternative & Advanced Search Engine Intelligence (ASSEI)

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Length: 4 hours

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Instructor: Joe Gray

Alternative & Advanced Search Engine Intelligence (ASSEI) is a fast paced course to amplify students' existing
OSINT/Intelligence and Search Engines Knowledge. The course will introduce students to non-Google, regional, and 
specialized search engines then walk students through advanced Google dorking with relevant real-world scenarios rooted
in offensive security, defensive security, and Intelligence.

This course counts toward The OSINTion Black Badge.

#### Introduction to Cryptocurrency Investigations (ICI)

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Length: 4 hours

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Instructor: Joe Gray

Introduction to Cryptocurrency Investigations (ICI) is a foundational course to help students with zero knowledge about 
cryptocurrency and blockchain get the basic comprehension for the technologies then thrust into introductory 
investigation techniques using free tools.

This course counts toward The OSINTion Black Badge.

#### Tactical Windows Forensics

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Length: 8 hours

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Instructor: Tyler Hudak

This class will take students through multiple labs that are designed to teach them key Windows forensics skills. Unlike
other courses, students will start with the labs and learn by doing.

Course requirements  -

Students should bring a laptop with two VMs:
- One Windows VM
- One forensic VM (https://tsurugi-linux.org/ is good)

VM software should be able to take snapshots.

All other materials will be supplied.

#### Intro to Threat Hunting: A Hands on Blueteam Battleground!

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Length: 4 hours

{:.h5 .mb-3}
Instructor: Adam "Abe" Abernethy

This interactive classroom involves learning the basics of using a SIEM.  From there we'll quickly advance to running 
simulated attacks (or real attacks if you want!) on a Windows Server.

As we progress through the training and labs, we'll escalate into more and more difficult attacks to detect, discuss 
what they are doing to a system and different ways to detect the attacks.

Abes classrooms are always incredibly serious, no funny business, no squirrels, no hair-metal, and ABSOLUTELY NO GIGGLING.

The entire cyber battleground will be provided through hosted virtual machines - just bring a laptop with some internet 
juice!
