#### CFP Guideline

We are looking for a variety of topics to be presented at this year’s con. Additionally, this year, we are seeking a mix of shorter, simple talks and longer, more detailed talks.  We’re targeting 20 and 50 minutes respectively.

We are generally looking for any kind of security/hacking related talks. But specifically to match our theme, we’d love to see presentations regarding:

- Cryptography
- Secure Communications
- Secure Desktops/OS
- Privacy
- Anonymity/Pseudonymity
- Embedded Systems or IoT
- Mobile (OS, application, baseband, etc.)
- Application Security
- Network Penetration Testing
- DFIR
- Hacker Community and infosec industry perspectives
- Tool release

Our team will review any talk submission but our only rule is that we will not accept a talk about a service or product you or your employer is selling. Please make all talks technical in nature.

#### Training Day Guidelines

The form above is also used for Training day ideas. The training day will be the day before the conference
hosted at RIT. In most cases, can we facilitate all the presentation gear like projectors, screens, and
possibly workstations. Normally classes are either 4 or 8 hours total.

**Subjects**: Anything technical in nature that you think our attendees would like to learn. See the above
list for some ideas.

**Pricing**: It's up to you the cost structure for your class. BSidesROC would appreciate a small amount
to cover our effort to setup the event, handle tickets, and keep the event going
for years to come, but the main goal is to provide
quality training to our attendees. Our past trainings have ranged from $500 or less with a median being
$25/person. We're happy to charge whatever you think is reasonable for your time.
 We recommend that you do not provide the class for free because in our experience, many people
will sign up for the free class and only half will attend. This makes the BSidesROC organizers lives more
difficult. If you are set on not receiving any money, consider donating it directly to a worthy cause such
as the EFF or maybe your favorite local B-Sides conference. :)


#### Who Is The Audience?

When considering a submission for BSidesROC, it may be helpful to consider who our attendees have been in the past. Check out our [about](/about) page that gives you some details about our
demographics. We have a mix of students and professionals but in general, management/sales slides
do not go over well in this crowd.
