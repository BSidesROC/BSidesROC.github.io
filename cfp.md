#### CFP Guideline

We are looking for a variety of topics to be presented at this year’s con. Additionally, this year, we are seeking a mix of shorter, simple talks and longer, more detailed talks.  We’re targeting 20 and 50 minutes respectively.

We are generally looking for any kind of security/hacking related talks. But specifically to match our theme, we’d love to see presentations regarding:

- Cryptography
- Secure Communications
- Secure Desktops/OS
- Privacy
- Anonymity/Pseudonymity
- Embedded Systems or IoT
- Mobile (OS, application, baseband, etc.)
- Application Security
- Network Penetration Testing
- DFIR
- Hacker Community and infosec industry perspectives
- Tool release

Our team will review any talk submission but our only rule is that we will not accept a talk about a service or product you or your employer is selling. Please make all talks technical in nature.

#### Training Day Guidelines

The form above is also used for Training day ideas. The training day will be the day before the conference
hosted at RIT. In most cases, can we facilitate all the presentation gear like projectors, screens, and
possibly workstations. Normally classes are either 4 or 8 hours total.

**Subjects**: Anything technical in nature that you think our attendees would like to learn. See the above
list for some ideas.

**Pricing**: The cost structure for your class is up to you.  We're happy to
charge whatever you think is reasonable for your time.  We suggest that you keep
in mind the number of attendees who are students, though, and try to keep ticket
costs relatively low.  Our past trainings have been $500 or less, with a median
of about $25-50/person.  BSidesROC asks for 15% of ticket sales to cover our
efforts in managing the event.  And if you want to run a class for free, we will
charge (and keep) $20 per student simply to minimize no-shows.


#### Who Is The Audience?

When considering a submission for BSidesROC, it may be helpful to consider who our attendees have been in the past. Check out our [about](/about) page that gives you some details about our
demographics. We have a mix of students and professionals but in general, management/sales slides
do not go over well in this crowd.
