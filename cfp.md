We are generally looking for any kind of security/hacking related talks. But specifically to match our theme, weâ€™d love to see presentations regarding:

    Cryptography
    Secure Communications
    Secure Desktops/OS
    Privacy
    Anonymity/Pseudonymity
    Embedded Systems or IoT
    Mobile (OS, application, baseband, etc.)
    Application Security
    Network Penetration Testing
    DFIR
    Hacker Community and infosec industry perspectives
    Tool release
    Hacking all the things

Our team will review any talk submission but our only rule is that we will not accept a talk about a service or product you or your employer is selling. Please make all talks technical in nature.

If you have a talk and don't think it will fit with the list, submit it anyway, We love obscure content that might just what we are looking for!
The name and photo associated with your Google account will ****be recorded when you upload files and submit this form.
