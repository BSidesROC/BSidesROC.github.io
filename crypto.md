# Crypto Challenge

Crypto Challenge
Do you like puzzles? Do you like riddles? Do you like crypto? (Remember, we’re not talking about cryptocurrency here. CRYPTO MEANS CRYPTOGRAPHY!)

Do you like being driven slowly or not-so-slowly insane, but in bite-sized chunks that you can consume throughout the day?

Then you’ll love the BSidesROC Crypto Challenge. This is an event in which participants must crack a series of codes, ciphers, and other technical puzzles for fame and glory, or at least bragging rights. This year’s crypto challenge is designed by the aptly-named Crypty McCryptoFace. The URL for the challenge will be provided when the contest opens.

All contestants must be present on-site to win.
