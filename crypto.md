Do you like puzzles?  Do you like riddles?  Do you like crypto?
(Remember, we're not talking about cryptocurrency here.  CRYPTO MEANS
CRYPTOGRAPHY!)

Do you like being driven slowly or not-so-slowly insane, but in bite-sized
chunks that you can consume throughout the day?

Then you'll love the BSidesROC Crypto Challenge.  This is an event in which
participants must crack a series of codes, ciphers, and other technical
puzzles for fame and glory, or at least bragging rights.
This year's crypto challenge is designed by the aptly-named Crypty
McCryptoFace.  The URL for the challenge will be provided when the contest
opens.

All contestants must be present on-site to win.
